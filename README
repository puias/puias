PUIAS Princeton University/Institute for Advanced Study Linux

This repository holds the spec files, patches and contributed sources for
building the PUIAS distribution.

There are the following main directories

  * core - base repository, packages provided upstream are not represented
		unless modified.
  * addons - packages that are updated often and supported 
	* computational - similar to addons but focused on computational and
	  scientific 
  * unsupported - unsupported repository, packages that may not
	  be updated frequently and may not be forward ported to new releases.

Within each of these directories, each package has it's own directory, in
the package directory is a  SPECS and SOURCES directory.  SPECS holds the
rpm spec file and SOURCES has the patches and locally modified sources,
original sources are not version controlled.
